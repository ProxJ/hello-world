# hello-world
Just another repository
I just wish i find this very helpful. I know it will be helpful if I use it in the right way. I just wish to discover it quickly.
I wanna move from beginner to  expert or at the end of the year. In two years time, a proffesional. I know it's impossible to say you're a pro, but then I just aspire to create a good game, and applications by then like proffesionals and keep upgrading my skilss as time goes. So help me God!
